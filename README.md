# aimotive
This is my "homework" for aiMotive. All code is written by me, altough I have used the help of internet.

Python libraries I used are: numpy, pandas, open3d. 

All four solutions for the exercises can be found in one code (.ipynb). I have added all used photos in 'kepek' library, if you would like to take a closer look at them.
